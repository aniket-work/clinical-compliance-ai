# Autonomous Clinical Trial Protocol Compliance Intelligence

![Title Animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aniket-work/clinical-compliance-ai/main/images/title-animation-v3.gif)

## Overview
This repository contains an experimental Proof of Concept (PoC) for an **Autonomous Clinical Trial Compliance Intelligence** system. I built this to explore how a multi-agent AI architecture can solve the massive bottleneck of manual regulatory compliance checks in the healthcare industry.

By leveraging specialized AI agents, the system cross-references complex clinical trial protocols against a knowledge base of FDA, EMA, and GDPR regulations to identify risks, gaps, and compliance scores.

## Key Features
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Three specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer, Synthesizer) working in tandem.
2. **Regulatory Intelligence**: Automated retrieval of relevant regulatory frameworks.
3. **Statistical Risk Analysis**: Generation of data-driven insights with visual charts.
4. **Automated Audit Reporting**: Synthesis of raw audit data into executive-level summaries.

## System Architecture & Execution

### Terminal Run
I've implemented a detailed logging system to track agent collaboration in real-time. Here is a snapshot of the system in action:

## Business Insights & Statistics

I designed this PoC to not only analyze protocols but to provide actionable data. Below are some of the statistical outputs generated by the system:

| Metric | Analysis Goal |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Compliance Health** | Overall health of the trial protocol against standards. |
| **Risk Correlation** | Identifying how protocol complexity impacts regulatory gaps. |
| **Latency Distribution** | Monitoring the efficiency of the multi-agent synthesis. |
